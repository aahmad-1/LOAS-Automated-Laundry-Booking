# LOAS Automated Laundry Booking Bot

## Project Overview
This project automates the laundry booking process for LOAS (presumably a housing or residential service). It uses Selenium to interact with a website, automating the login and booking steps.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Automated Booking:** Eliminates the need for manual booking, saving time and effort.
*   **User-Friendly:** Simple command-line interface for providing credentials.
*   **Time Saving:** Automatically checks for available slots and makes reservations.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Python 3.6+:**  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
*   **Selenium:** Python library for browser automation. Install using `pip install selenium`.
*   **ChromeDriver:** Download the ChromeDriver executable that matches your Chrome browser version and ensure it's in your system's PATH or specify its location in the script. Get it from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
*   **Chrome Browser:** The script uses Chrome to automate the booking process.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aahmad-1/LOAS-Automated-Laundry-Booking.git
    cd LOAS-Automated-Laundry-Booking
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

3.  **Download ChromeDriver:**

    *   Download the appropriate ChromeDriver version for your Chrome browser from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
    *   Extract the `chromedriver` executable.
    *   Place the `chromedriver` executable in a directory included in your system's PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS). Alternatively, you can specify the path to the `chromedriver` executable directly in the script.

## Usage Examples

1.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

2.  **Enter your credentials:**

    *   The script will prompt you to enter your email and password.

    ```
    === LOAS Laundry Booking Bot ===
    Enter your email: your_email@example.com
    Enter your password: your_password
    ```

3. **Adapt the script**:

The script requires modification to include the URL of the laundry booking site and the steps for selecting the booking time and dates, as these are not provided in the original extract. Also, you might need to inspect the page source in order to adjust the `By` element selectors.

## Configuration Options

There are currently no configuration options exposed as command-line arguments or environment variables.  However, you may need to adjust the following parameters within the script.

*   **ChromeDriver path:** If ChromeDriver is not in your system's PATH, you will need to specify its path when initializing the `webdriver.Chrome` service.
*   **Website URL:** Update the URL to match the specific URL for your LOAS laundry booking system.
*   **CSS Selectors/XPath:** The script depends on specific CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate elements on the page. You will need to modify these if the website's structure changes.
*   **Booking time/date**: You need to add functionality to define the date and time for your booking.
